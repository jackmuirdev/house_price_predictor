# Random Forest Regression for Inflation Prediction

This project aims to predict inflation rates using Random Forest regression. It includes scripts for training a Random Forest model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions for future periods.

## Project Description

Inflation prediction is essential for various financial and economic analyses. This project leverages Random Forest regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to forecast inflation rates based on historical data. The model learns patterns from past inflation data and uses them to make predictions for future periods.
